title: 'Pomodoro Chicken Flutter Migration'
description: To reduce the server's role, optimize for mobile, and integrate AdMob, I migrated the existing PWA to Flutter over a span of three weeks. During this process, I gained knowledge in cross-platform and mobile development. I also used the certificate generated during the initial PWA deployment to update and release version 1.1.0.
