title: 'Pomodoro Chicken: Character Collection Pomodoro Timer'
description: This is a service that adds a character collection feature to a Pomodoro timer. It is built with React and PWA, making it feel like a fully native app on mobile devices, and the PWA version 1.0.0 has been deployed to the Play Store. I was responsible for content creation using AI, design, frontend, and server using Nest. Additionally, I configured the server architecture to be split between Spring and Nest.
