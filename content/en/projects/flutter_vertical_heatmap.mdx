title: 'Open Source: flutter_vertical_heatmap'
description: This package provides a vertical scrolling heatmap. Due to requests for features in another heatmap package that is no longer being updated, I open-sourced a widget developed in a previous project. By fully adhering to documentation, testing, comments, and coding style standards, it received a perfect score of 140/140 on pub.dev.
