description: This is a music site I created as soon as App Router and Server Actions in NextJS 13.4 were stabilized, driven by curiosity. At that time, there were no best practice examples for RSC-based architecture, so I devised a design suitable for RSC and Server Actions, inspired by hexagonal architecture.
